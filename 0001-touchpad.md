These are the contents to add in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf` (especially if you use _Fedora_[^fedora]):

[^fedora]: It is only a _Linux_ distribution, I know. But I donâ€™t know whether other distributions may have a different path for these files (in any case, under the `/etc` directory).

```
