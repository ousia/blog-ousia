I use _Fedora_ on my main computer---which is a latop. When a new version is released, I install it from scratch.

Since I want to install all the packages that I had in the previous version, I need a complete list to install these with the newer version.

rpm -qa
```

This will list all installed packages. To get the alphabetically--ordered list in a file (such as `fedora-27-packages.txt`[^namesample]):

[^namesample]: Of course, it is only an example. You may use any other file name. Either it doesnâ€™t contain blank spaces, or you have to enclose the name in quotation marks.

```
rpm -qa | sort > fedora-27-packages.txt
```


RPM has a way of doing it right:
